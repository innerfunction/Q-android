# Q-android: Asynchronous Promise implementation for Android.

This library brings the concept of deferred promises from the JS world to Android.  

Promises allow to run asynchronous functions to prevent other code from interfering with the progress or status of its internal request.

Promises are useful when making asyc calls in your code.
